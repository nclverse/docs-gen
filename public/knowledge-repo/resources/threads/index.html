<h3 id="sec-1-3-1">No Root Cause</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-1" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Single point failures don't cause failures, only a combination of
them does lead to failure. Post accident attribution to a root
cause is patently wrong since overt failure requires multiple
faults. There is no no isolated cause of an accident. There are
multiple contributors which are insufficient in itself to create
accidents. Only a combination of them creates an accident. The
evaluations based on such reasoning as root cause do not reflect a
technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the
social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or
events for outcomes. Hindsight bias also clutters it and makes it
seem that the practitioners at the time was aware. This remains
the primary obstacle to accident investigation, especially when
expert human performance is involved.

<h3 id="sec-1-3-2">All practitioner actions are gambles.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
After accidents, the overt failure often appears to have been
inevitable and the practitioner’s actions as blunders or
deliberate willful disregard of certain impending failure. But all
practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take
place in the face of uncertain outcomes.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-3-3">Actions at the sharp end resolve all ambiguity.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the
relationship between production targets, efficient use of
resources, economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks
of low and high consequence accidents. All ambiguity is resolved
by actions of practitioners at the sharp end of the system. After
an accident, practitioner actions may be regarded as ‘errors’ or
‘violations’ but these evaluations are heavily biased by hindsight
and ignore the other driving forces, especially production
pressure.

<p>
These adaptations often occur on a moment by moment basis.  Some
of these adaptations include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Restructuring the system in order to reduce exposure of vulnerable
parts to failure.
</li>

<li>Concentrating critical resources in areas of expected high demand.
</li>

<li>Providing pathways for retreat or recovery from expected and unexpected faults.

<h3 id="sec-1-3-5">Change introduces new forms of failure.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The low rate of overt accidents in reliable systems may encourage
changes, especially the use of new technology, to decrease the
number of low consequence but high frequency failures. These
changes maybe actually create opportunities for new, low frequency
but high consequence failures.
</p>

<p>
When new technologies are used to eliminate well understood system
failures or to gain high precision performance they often
introduce new pathways to large scale, catastrophic failures.
</p>

<p>
Not uncommonly, these new, rare catastrophes have even greater
impact than those eliminated by the new technology.  These new
forms of failure are difficult to see before the fact; attention
is paid mostly to the putative beneficial characteristics of the
changes. Because these new, high consequence accidents occur at a
low rate, multiple system changes may occur before an accident,
making it hard to see the contribution of technology to the
failure.

<h3 id="sec-1-3-6">On fixing errors</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-6" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Views of 'cause' limit the effectiveness of defenses against
future events.  Post-accident remedies for “human error” are
usually predicated on obstructing activities that can 'cause'
accidents. These end-of-the-chain measures do little to reduce the
likelihood of further accidents. In fact that likelihood of an
identical accident is already extraordinarily low because the
pattern of latent failures changes constantly. Instead of
increasing safety, post-accident remedies usually increase the
coupling and complexity of the system. This increases the
potential number of latent failures and also makes the detection
and blocking of accident trajectories more difficult.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-1-3-7">
<h3 id="sec-1-3-7">Safety is a characteristic of systems and not of their components</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a
person, device or department of an organization or system. Safety
cannot be purchased or manufactured; it is not a feature that is
separate from the other components of the system. This means that
safety cannot be manipulated like a feed stock or raw material. The
state of safety in any system is always dynamic; continuous
systemic change insures that hazard and its management are
constantly changing.
</p>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-1-3-8">
<h3 id="sec-1-3-8">Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-8" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The sheer fact that there are a lot of components within the
systems allows for multiple permutations of failure to occur and
the complexity of these systems makes it impossible for them to
cause failure. Failures change constantly because of changing
technology, work organization, efforts to eradicate failures.

<h3 id="sec-1-3-9">Complex systems run in degraded mode.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-9" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Complex systems run as broken systems. The system continues to
function because it contains so many redundancies and because
people can make it function, despite the presence of many
flaws. After accident reviews nearly always note that the system
has a history of prior proto-accidents that nearly generated
catastrophe. Arguments that these degraded conditions should have
been recognized before the overt accident are usually predicated
on naïve notions of system performance. System operations are
dynamic, with components (organizational, human, technical)
failing and being replaced continuously.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-3" id="outline-container-sec-1-3-10">
<h3 id="sec-1-3-10">Failure free operations require experience with failure.</h3>
<div id="text-1-3-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
One who plays with fire can only prevent it.  Recognizing hazard
and successfully manipulating system operations to remain inside
the tolerable performance boundaries requires intimate contact with
failure. More robust system performance is likely to arise in
systems where operators can discern the “edge of the
envelope”. This is where system performance begins to deteriorate,
becomes difficult to predict, or cannot be readily recovered. In
intrinsically hazardous systems, operators are expected to
encounter and appreciate hazards in ways that lead to overall
performance that is desirable. Improved safety depends on providing
operators with calibrated views of the hazards. It also depends on
providing calibration about how their actions move system
performance towards or away from the edge of the envelope.

<h2 id="sec-1-4">Computer Software</h2>
<div id="text-1-4" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Software that gives form and purpose to a programmable machine, much
as a sculptor shapes clay.
</p>

<p>
Computers are to computing as instruments are to music. Software is
the score, whose interpretation amplifies our reach and lifts our
spirit. Leonardo da Vince called music, "the shaping of the
invisible." As in the case of music, the invisibility of software is
no more mysterious than where your lap goes when you stand up.
</p>

<p>
True mystery of computer science: How so much can be accomplished with
the simplest of materials, given the right architecture.
</p>

<p>
Information is any difference that makes a difference. - Gregory Bateson
The intrinsic meaning of a mark is that it is there. The first
difference is the mark, the second one alludes to the need for interpretation.
</p>

<p>
The same notation that specifies elevator music specifies the organ
fugues of Bach. In a computer the same notation can specify actuarial
tables or bring a new world to life. 
</p>

<p>
As with most media from which things are built, whether the thing is a
cathedral, a bacterium, a sonnet, a fugue or a word processor,
architecture dominates material. To understand clay is not to
understand the pot. What a pot is all about can be appreciated better
by understanding the creators and the users of the pot and their need
both to inform the material with meaning and to extract meaning from
the form.
</p>

<p>
There is a qualitative difference between the computer as a medium of
expression and clay or paper. Like the genetic apparatus of a living
cell, the computer can read, write and follow its own markings to
levels of self-interpretation whose intellectual limits are still not
understood.
</p>

<p>
Hence the task for someone who wants to understand software is not
simply to see the pot instead of the clay. It is to see in pots thrown
by beginners (for all are beginners in the fledging profession of
computer science) the possibility of the Chinese porcelain and Limoges
to come.

A quantitative improvement in terms of response times in a UI can have
a qualitative improvement. A crabby UI that doesn't respond to a user

Much of life's visual and auditory interaction depends on it's pace.
</p>

<p>
As children we discovered that clay can be shaped into any form simply
by shoving both hands into the stuff. Most of us have learned no such
thing about the computer. Its material seems as detached from human
experience as a radioactive ingot being manipulated remotely with
buttons, tongs and a television monitor.
</p>

<p>
One feels the clay of computing through the "user interface"; the
software that mediates between a person and the programs shaping the
computer into a tool for a specific goal, wetter the goal is designing
a bridge or writing an article. The user interface was once the last
part of a system to be designed. Now it is the first. It is recognized
as being primary because to novices and professionals alike, what is
presented to one's senses is one's computer. The user illusion as my
colleagues and I called it at the Xerox Paolo Alto Research Center, is
the simplified myth everyone builds to explain (and make guesses
about) the system's actions and what should be done next.
</p>

<p>
The objective of user illusion is to amplify the user's ability to
simulate. A person exerts the greatest leverage when his illusion can
be manipulated without appeal to abstract intermediaries such as the
hidden programs needed to put into action even a simple word
processor. What I call direct leverage is provided when the illusion
acts a kit or tool with which to solve a problem. Indirect leverage
will be attained when the illusion acts as an agent. An active
extension of one's purpose and goals.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the software designer's control of what is essentially a
theatrical context is the key to creating an illusion and enhancing
its perceived "friendliness."
</p>

<p>
The earliest computer programs were designed by mathematicians and
scientists who thought the task should be straightforward and
logical. Software turned out to be harder to shape than they had
supposed. Computers were stubborn. They insisted on doing what was said
rather than what the programmer meant. As a result a new class of
artisans took over the task. These test pilots of the binary biplane
were often neither mathematical nor even very scientific, but they
were deeply engaged in a romance with the material -a romance that is
often the precursor of new arts and sciences alike. Natural scientists
are given a universe and seek to discover its laws. Computer
scientists make laws in the form of programs and the computer bring a
new universe to life.
</p>

<p>
Nature sets out a system and humans describe it vs. Humans describe a system
and things fall out from it with ability to restart it.
</p>

<p>
Most system programmers discovered that it is one thing to be the god
of a universe and to be able to control it. Emergent behaviors are
hard to predict (Was this demonstrated in the evaluation of the design?)
</p>

<p>
A powerful genre can serve as wings or chains. The most treacherous
metaphors are the ones that seem to work for a time, because they can
keep more powerful insights from bubbling up.
</p>

<p>
Intangible message embedded in a material medium is the essence of
computer software.
</p>

<p>
Strong representatives from each past era thrive today, such as
programming in the 30-year-old language known as FORTRAN and even in
the ancient script known as direct machine code. Some people might
look on such relics as living fossils; others would point out that
even a very old species might still be filling a particular ecological niche.
</p>

<p>
The computer field has not yet had its Galileo or Newton, Bach or
Beethoven, Shakespeare or Moliere. What it needs first is a William of
Occam, who said "Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily." The
idea that it is worthwhile to put considerable effort into eliminating
complexity and establishing the simple had a lot to do with the rise
of modern science and mathematics, particularly from the standpoint of
creating new aesthetics, a vital ingredient of any growing field. It
is an aesthetic along the lines of Occam's razor that is needed both
to judge current computer software and to inspire future designs. Just
how many concepts are there really? And how can metaphor, the magical
process of finding similarity and even identity in diverse structures,
be put to work to reduce complexity?
</p>

<p>
The world of symbolic can be dealt with effectively only when the
repetitious aggregation of concrete instances becomes boring enough to
motivate exchanging them for a single abstract insight.
</p>

<p>
The designers of computing systems like the metaphors have learned to
do the same thing as Newton and Leibniz with programming methods that
have the property called inheritance.
</p>

<p>
Designing the parts to have the same power as the whole is a
fundamental technique in contemporary software.
</p>

<p>
The move to object-oriented design represents a real change in POV - a
change of paradigm - that brings with it an enormous increase in
expressive power. There was a similar change when molecular chains
floating randomly in a prebiological ocean had their efficiency,
robustness and energetic possibilities boosted a billionfold when they
were first enclosed within a cell membrane.
</p>

<p>
The early applications of software objects were attempted in the
context of the old metaphor of sequential programming languages, and
the objects functioned like colonies of cooperating unicellular
organisms. If cells are a good idea, however they really start to make
things happen when the cooperation is close enough for the cells to
aggregate into super cells: tissues and organs. Can the endlessly
malleable fabric of computer stuff be designed to form a super object?
</p>

<p>
"Better old thing" that is likely to be one of the "Almost new things"
for the mainstream designs for the next few years.
</p>

<p>
A spreadsheet is a simulated pocket universe that continuously
maintains its fabric; it is a kit for a surprising range of
applications. Here the user illustration is simple, direct and powerful.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic spreadsheets were invented by Daniel Bricklin and Robert
Frankston as a reaction to the frustration Bricklin felt when he had
to work with the old ruled-paper versions in business school. They
were surprised by the success of the idea and by the fact that most
people who bought the first spreadsheet program (VisiCalc) exploited
it to forecast the future rather than to account for the past. Seeking
to develop a "smart editor" they had created a simulation tool.
</p>

<p>
The strongest test of any system is not how well its features conform
to an anticipated needs but how well it performs when one wants to do
something the designer did not foresee. It is a question less of
possibility than of perspicuity.
</p>

<p>
Users must be able to tailor system to their wants. Anything less
would be absurd as requiring essays to be formed out of paragraphs
that have already been written.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that in shaping software kits the limitations on design
are those of the creator and the user, not those of the medium. The
question of software's limitations is brought front and center,
however by my contention that in the future a stronger kind of
indirect leverage will be provided by personal agents: extensions of
the user's will and purposes shaped from and embedded in the stuff of
the computer. Can material give rise to mentality?
</p>

<p>
Atoms also seem quite innocent. Yet biology demonstrates that simple
materials can be formed into exceedingly complex organizations that
can interpret themselves and change themselves dynamically. Some of
them even appear to think! It is therefore hard to deny certain mental
possibilities to computer material, since software's strong suit is
similarly the kinetic structuring of simple components. Computers "can
only do what they are programmed to do." but the same is true of a
fertilized egg trying to become a baby.
</p>

<p>
For the composer of software the computer is like a bottle of atoms
waiting to be shaped by an architecture he must invent and then
impress from the outside.
</p>

<p>
To pursue the biological analogy, evolution can tell the genes very
little about the world and the genes can tell the developing brain
still less. All levels of mental competence are found in the more than
one and a half million surviving species. The range is from behavior
so totally hard-wired that learning is neither needed nor possible, to
templates that are elaborated by the experience, to a spectrum of
capabilities so fluid that they require a stable social organization -
a culture - if full adult potential is to be realized. In other words,
the gene's way to get a cat to catch mice is to program the cat to
play - and let the mice teach the rest. Workers in artificial
intelligence have generally contented themselves with attempting to
mimic only the first, hard-wired kind of behavior. The results are
often called expert systems, but in a sense they are the designer
jeans of computer science.
</p>

<p>
Any medium powerful enough to extend man's reach is powerful enough to
topple his world. To get the medium's magic to work for one's aim
rather than against them is to attain literacy.
</p>

<p>
The protean nature of the computer is such that it can act like a
machine or like a language to be shaped and exploited. It is a medium
that can dynamically simulate the details of any other medium,
including media that cannot exist physically. It is not a tool,
although it can act like many tools. It is the first meta-medium and as
such it has degrees of freedom for representation and expression never
before encountered and as yet barely investigated. Even more
important, it is fun, and therefore intrinsically worth doing.
</p>

<p>
by reading we hope not only to absorb the facts of our civilization
and of those before us but also to encounter the very structure and
style of thought and imagination. Writing get us out of the bleachers
and onto the playing field; old and new knowledge becomes truly ours
as we shape it directly.

<div id="text-1-7" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Almost a new thing vs. Better old thing.
Most ideas come from previous ideas.
<i>This project is a realization of these new points of view as parented
by its predecessors.</i>
</p>

<p>
Small minds try to form religions, the great ones just want better
routes up the mountain.
</p>

<p>
Smalltalk is a recursion on the notion of computer itself.
</p>

<p>
the semantics of Smalltalk are a bit like having thousands and
thousands of computers all hooked together by a very fast network.
</p>

<p>
Questions of concrete representation can thus be postponed almost
indefinitely because we are mainly concerned that the computers behave
appropriately and are interested in particular strategies only if the
results are off or come back too slowly. (Alluding to verification and
performance times)
</p>

<p>
Make simple problems simple and complex problems achievable.
</p>

<p>
New ideas go through stages of acceptance, both from within and
without. From within, the sequence moves from "barely seeing" a
pattern several times, then noting it but not perceiving its cosmic
significance, then using it operationally in several areas, then comes
a grand rotation in which the pattern becomes the center of a new way
of thinking, and finally, it turns into the same kind of inflexible
religion that it orginally broke away from.
</p>

<p>
From without, as Schopenhauer noted, the new idea is first denounced
as the work of the insane, in a few years it is considered obivous and
mundane, and finally the original denouncers will claim to have
invented it.

The philosophy is about opinion and engineering is about deeds, with
science the happy medium somewhere in between.
